# Time Series Analysis
 
In this project, I intended to forecast 5 values into the future, using methods such as Exponential Smoothing, Box-Jenkins, Regression and Decomposition. The series used in the project showing the monthly employed population numbers in Turkey between the period of 01.2014 - 12.2022 was taken from the basic labour force statistics published by TURKSTAT. Analyses were made in R Studio.
